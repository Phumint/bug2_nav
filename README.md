# TurtleBot3 Bug and Potential Field Algorithm (ROS 2)

A custom ROS 2 package for TurtleBot3 that implements autonomous navigation using **Bug Algorithms** (Bug0, Bug1, Bug2) and **Potential Field Obstacle Avoidance** in custom Gazebo worlds with custom models.

This package and documentation are inspired by concepts from the textbook *Lectures on Robotic Planning and Kinematics* by Francesco Bullo and Stephen L. Smith.
